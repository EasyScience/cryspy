**easyDiffraction**
------------------------------------------

**easyDiffraction** allows simulation of diffraction patterns 
based on a structural model and refinement of its parameters. 
It is similar to crystallographic programs like **FullProf**, **Jana**, 
**GSAS**, **ShelX**, etc.

It is based on external crystallographic libraries, such as **CrysPy** 
in order to cover different functionality aspects within 
a single intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface. 

This program is probably the easiest way to use **CrysPy** library
for the refinement of one dimensional polarized neutron powder diffraction data.
