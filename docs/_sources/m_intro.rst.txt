Starting the **CrysPy**
=============================

There are several ways to use **CrysPy** library:

1. GUI program: **easyDiffraction**
2. GUI program: **CrysPy Editor** 
3. Jupyter notebook / Python scripts

GUI "easyDiffraction" 
------------------------------------------

**easyDiffraction** allows simulation of diffraction patterns 
based on a structural model and refinement of its parameters. 
It is similar to crystallographic programs like **FullProf**, **Jana**, 
**GSAS**, **ShelX**, etc.

It is based on external crystallographic libraries, such as **CrysPy** 
in order to cover different functionality aspects within 
a single intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface. 

This program is probably the easiest way to use **CrysPy** library
for refinement of one dimensional polarized neutron powder diffraction data.


For more information read official page of `easyDiffraction software <https://easyDiffraction.org>`_.


GUI "CrysPy Editor"
-----------------------------------

**Cryspy Editor** is a nice instrument to explore all functionality of the library.
The basic operations of the library are well documented. 
All process can be performed inside the given editor from the description of crystal phases to 
the refinement of experimental data supported in CrysPy library. 
The implemented "Wizard" allows expand the functionality of the library for you personal usage 
(the skils of python programing is needed).

Jupyter notebook /  Python scripts
-----------------------------------

The `Jupyter Notebook <https://jupyter.org/>`_ is an open-source 
web application 
that allows you to create and share documents that contain 
live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.
It becames a popular instrument for the data analysis.
In the next section the restricted number of example shows the general methods which allows you
to create and to manipulate with given objects.
